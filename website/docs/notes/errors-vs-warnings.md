title: Errors vs. warnings
---

From W3C’s [manual](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/manual.html):

> The validator can give you two types of messages: errors and warnings. Errors are given when the checked CSS does not respect the CSS recommendation. Warnings are different from errors since they do not state a problem regarding the specification. They are here to warn that some points might be dangerous and could lead to a strange behavior on some user agents.
